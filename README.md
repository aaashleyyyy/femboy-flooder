# femboy-flooder
0x150's femboy-flooder but way worse and more convincing.

There a jar with extra file size to make the jar more convincing in releases.

You can easily change the rule34.xxx image tag by navigating to src/main/java/cum.java, on line 26, there is this code " String resp = getHTML("https://rule34.xxx/index.php?page=dapi&s=post&q=index&tags=guro&limit=" + winAmount);" at the end of it, replace the "guro" with whatever tag you want.
